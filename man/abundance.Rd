\usage{
abundance(x, taxLev = "Family", unassigned = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{results of function aggregatoR}

\item{taxLev}{taxonomic level on which the calculation has to be made.}

\item{unassigned}{Does unassigned taxa need to be taken into account? If yes set unassigned to TRUE, otherwise FALSE.}
}
\description{
This function allow the calculation of abundances with the possibility to exlude unassigned taxon.
}
\details{
If unassigned equal to TRUE calculated abundances are equal among taxonomic levels.

\examples{
data(macro_ex)
data.bio <- asBiomonitor(macro_ex)
data.agR <- aggregatoR(data.bio)
abundance(data.agR, taxLev = "Family" )
