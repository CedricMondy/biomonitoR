\usage{
ffeve(x, traitDB = NULL, agg = FALSE, dfref = NULL,
  traitSel = FALSE, colB = NULL, taxLev = "Taxa",
  correction = "none", traceB = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{results of function aggregatoR}

\item{traitDB}{a trait data base with a column \code{Taxa} and the other columns
containing the traits. Needed only if users use their own trait database.  If a trait has several modalities they should be
named as follow: TRAIT_MODALITY.

By default, the data base used is the one from Tachet \emph{et al} (2010) that
can be retrieved from
\href{https://www.freshwaterecology.info/}{freshwaterecology.info} website
(Schmidt-Kloiber & Hering, 2015).}

\item{agg}{should ffrich aggregate user's traitDB of higher taxonomic level? TRUE to aggregate, otherwise FALSE.
For instance, if user's traitDB has both Halesus and Limnephilidae, ffred will aggregate traits value if agg = TRUE.}

\item{dfref}{reference database to be used when a custom trait database is provided and agg = TRUE.
It should be the same reference database used in \link{asBiomonitor} when dfref = TRUE.}

\item{traitSel}{interactively select traits. See details for more info.}

\item{colB}{A vector that contains the number of modalities for each trait. Needed only if users use their own trait database.}

\item{taxLev}{character string giving the taxonomic level used to retrieve
trait information. Possible levels are \code{"Taxa"}, \code{"Species"}, \code{"Genus"},
\code{"Family"} as returned by the \link{aggregatoR} function.}

\item{correction}{Options are \emph{sqrt}, \emph{cailliez}, \emph{lingoes}, or \emph{none}. Default to \emph{none}. See \link[FD]{dbFD} for more details.}

\item{traceB}{if TRUE ffred will return a list with 2 elements, the first being the ffrich values and the second the database used for the calculation. Useful to check missing taxa.}
}
\value{
A vector with functional dispersion results.\cr
If traceB is set to TRUE a list is provided with:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{results}: results of the ffred function;
\item \strong{traits}: a data.frame containing the traits used for the calculations;
\item \strong{taxa}: a data.frame conaining the taxa used for th calculations;
\item \strong{taxa_excluded}: a vector conaining the names of the taxa exluded from the calculations;
\item \strong{NA_detection}: a data.frame containing taxa on the first column and the corresponding trais with NAs on the second column.
}
}
\description{
TBD
}
\details{
Taxa without traits assigned in the trait database are removed from both the trait and abundance databases.

\note{
USE WITH CAUTION, STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
